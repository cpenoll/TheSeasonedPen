        <h2> Welcome to The Seasoned Pen!</h2>

            <p> Here you'll find various detailed recipes for all types of meals, both big and small, as well as multiple tasty drink and dessert recipes to enjoy! For easy navigation, each category of recipes are separated into 5 different books: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Desserts, and Drinks. These are all found on the home page of the site. <br>

After clicking on a booklet, you'll be redirected to the available list of recipes under the category you've clicked on, and once you find which recipe you'd like to look at or try, you can click on the name. There you'll find a page listing the necessary ingredients and the amounts needed to yield a certain amount of the food or drink. Scrolling down, you'll then find the recipe steps. <br>
